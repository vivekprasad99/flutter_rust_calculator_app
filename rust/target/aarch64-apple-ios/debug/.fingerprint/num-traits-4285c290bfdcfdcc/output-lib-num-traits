If using Cargo, add it to `[dependencies]`\n  in Cargo.toml.\n- The crate is present, but under a different name. If using Cargo, look for\n  `package = ` under `[dependencies]` in Cargo.toml.\n\n## Common causes for missing `std` or `core`\n\n- You are cross-compiling for a target which doesn't have `std` prepackaged.\n  Consider one of the following:\n  + Adding a pre-compiled version of std with `rustup target add`\n  + Building std from source with `cargo build -Z build-std`\n  + Using `#![no_std]` at the crate root, so you won't need `std` in the first\n    place.\n- You are developing the compiler itself and haven't built libstd from source.\n  You can usually build it with `x.py build library/std`. More information\n  about x.py is available in the [rustc-dev-guide].\n\n[rustc-dev-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#building-the-compiler\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/Users/vivekfraazo/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/num-traits-0.2.17/src/lib.rs","byte_start":18793,"byte_end":18797,"line_start":505,"line_end":505,"column_start":21,"column_end":25,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    clamp_max(0., ::core::f32::NAN);","highlight_start":21,"highlight_end":25}],"label":"can't find crate","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"the `aarch64-apple-ios` target may not be installed","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"consider downloading the target with `rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0463]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: can't find crate for `core`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0m/Users/vivekfraazo/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/num-traits-0.2.17/src/lib.rs:505:21\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m505\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m    clamp_max(0., ::core::f32::NAN);\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mcan't find crate\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: the `aarch64-apple-ios` target may not be installed\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mhelp\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: consider downloading the target with `rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios`\u001b[0m\n\n"}

Examples:\n\n```\nstruct Something;\n\nimpl Something {} // ok!\n\n// or:\n\ntrait Foo {\n    type N;\n\n    fn bar(_: Self::N); // ok!\n}\n\n// or:\n\nfn foo<T>(x: T) {} // ok!\n```\n\nAnother case that causes this error is when a type is imported into a parent\nmodule. To fix this, you can follow the suggestion and use File directly or\n`use super::File;` which will import the types from the parent namespace. An\nexample that causes this error is below:\n\n```compile_fail,E0412\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    fn some_function(f: File) {}\n}\n```\n\n```\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    // either\n    use super::File;\n    // or\n    // use std::fs::File;\n    fn foo(f: File) {}\n}\n# fn main() {} // don't insert it for us; that'll break imports\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/Users/vivekfraazo/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/num-traits-0.2.17/src/lib.rs","byte_start":9312,"byte_end":9318,"line_start":254,"line_end":254,"column_start":51,"column_end":57,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"                fn slice_shift_char(src: &str) -> Option<(char, &str)> {","highlight_start":51,"highlight_end":57}],"label":"not found in this scope","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"/Users/vivekfraazo/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/num-traits-0.2.17/src/lib.rs","byte_start":15822,"byte_end":15856,"line_start":392,"line_end":392,"column_start":1,"column_end":35,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"float_trait_impl!(Num for f32 f64);","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":35}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},"macro_decl_name":"float_trait_impl!","def_site_span":{"file_name":"/Users/vivekfraazo/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/num-traits-0.2.17/src/lib.rs","byte_start":7896,"byte_end":7925,"line_start":221,"line_end":221,"column_start":1,"column_end":30,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"macro_rules! float_trait_impl {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":30}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}}}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0412]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: cannot find type `Option` in this scope\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0m/Users/vivekfraazo/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/num-traits-0.2.17/src/lib.rs:254:51\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m254\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                fn slice_shift_char(src: &str) -> Option<(char, &str)> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                                                  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mnot found in this scope\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m392\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0mfloat_trait_impl!(Num for f32 f64);\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m----------------------------------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12min this macro invocation\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: this error originates in the macro `float_trait_impl` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\u001b[0m\n\n"}
